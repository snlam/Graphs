Some of them men think they freak this like we do
But, no, they don't
Make your check come at they neck
Disrespect us, no, they won't
Boy, don't even try to take us
Boy, this beat is crazy
This is how they made me
Houston, Texas, baby
This goes out to all my girls
That's in the club rocking the latest
Who will buy it for themselves
And get more money later
I think I need a barber
None of these can fire me
I'm so good with this
I remind you I'm so hood with this
Boy, I'm just playing
Come here, baby
Hope you still like me
If you hate me
My persuasion can build a nation
Endless power
Our love, we can devour
You'll do anything for me

It's hot up in here
DJ, don't be scared to run this, run this back
I'm repping for the girls who taking over the world
Have me raise a glass for the college grads
Anyone rolling, I'll let you know what time it is, check
You can't hold me, I broke my 9 to 5 better cut my check
This goes out to all the women getting it in, get on your grind
To the other men that respect what I do, please accept my shine
Boy, you know you love it
How we're smart enough to make these millions
Strong enough to bear the children
Then get back to business
See, you better not play me
Don't come here baby
Hope you still like me
If you hate me
My persuasion can build a nation
Endless power
Our love we can devour
You'll do anything for me
